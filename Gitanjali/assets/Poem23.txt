Art thou abroad on this stormy night on thy journey of love, my friend? The sky groans like one in despair.<br/>

I have no sleep tonight.<br/> Ever and again I open my door and look out on the darkness, my friend!<br/><br/>
I can see nothing before me.<br/> I wonder where lies thy path!<br/><br/>

By what dim shore of the ink-black river, by what far edge of the frowning forest, through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading thy course to come to me, my friend?<br/><br/>
