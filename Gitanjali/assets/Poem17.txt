I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands.<br/> That is why it is so late and why I have been guilty of such omissions.<br/><br/>

They come with their laws and their codes to bind me fast; but I evade them ever, for I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands.<br/><br/>

People blame me and call me heedless; I doubt not they are right in their blame.<br/><br/>

The market day is over and work is all done for the busy.<br/> Those who came to call me in vain have gone back in anger.<br/> I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands.<br/><br/>
