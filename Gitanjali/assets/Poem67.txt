Thou art the sky and thou art the nest as well.<br/><br/>

O thou beautiful, there in the nest is thy love that encloses the soul with colours and sounds and odours.<br/><br/>
There comes the morning with the golden basket in her right hand bearing the wreath of beauty, silently to crown the earth.<br/><br/>

And there comes the evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds, through trackless paths, carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden pitcher from the western ocean of rest.<br/><br/>

But there, where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her flight in, reigns the stainless white radiance. There is no day nor night, nor form nor colour, and never, never a word.<br/><br/>
