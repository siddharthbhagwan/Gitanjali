Thy gifts to us mortals fulfil all our needs and yet run back to thee undiminished.<br/><br/>

The river has its everyday work to do and hastens through fields and hamlets; yet its incessant stream winds towards the washing of thy feet.<br/><br/>

The flower sweetens the air with its perfume; yet its last service is to offer itself to thee.<br/><br/>

Thy worship does not impoverish the world.<br/><br/>

From the words of the poet men take what meanings please them; yet their last meaning points to thee.<br/><br/>
