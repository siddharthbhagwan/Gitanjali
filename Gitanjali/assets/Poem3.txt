I know not how thou singest, my master! I ever listen in silent amazement.<br/><br/>

The light of thy music illumines the world.<br/> The life breath of thy music runs from sky to sky.<br/> The holy stream of thy music breaks through all stony obstacles and rushes on.<br/><br/>

My heart longs to join in thy song, but vainly struggles for a voice.<br/> I would speak, but speech breaks not into song, and I cry out baffled.<br/> Ah, thou hast made my heart captive in the endless meshes of thy music, my master!<br/><br/>
