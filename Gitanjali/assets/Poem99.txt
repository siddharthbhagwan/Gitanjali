When I give up the helm I know that the time has come for thee to take it. What there is to do will be instantly done. Vain is this struggle.<br/><br/>

   Then take away your hands and silently put up with your defeat, my heart, and think it your good fortune to sit perfectly still where you are placed.<br/><br/>

   These my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind, and trying to light them I forget all else again and again.<br/><br/>
   
   But I shall be wise this time and wait in the dark, spreading my mat on the floor; and whenever it is thy pleasure, my lord, come silently and take thy seat here.<br/><br/>
