 Is it beyond thee to be glad with the gladness of this rhythm? to be tossed and lost and broken in the whirl of this fearful joy?<br/><br/>

All things rush on, they stop not, they look not behind, no power can hold them back, they rush on.<br/><br/>

Keeping steps with that restless, rapid music, seasons come dancing and pass away -- colours, tunes, and perfumes pour in endless cascades in the abounding joy that scatters and gives up and dies every moment.<br/><br/>
