When thou commandest me to sing it seems that my heart would break with pride; and I look to thy face, and tears come to my eyes.<br/><br/>

All that is harsh and dissonant in my life melts into one sweet harmony -- and my adoration spreads wings like a glad bird on its flight across the sea.<br/><br/>

I know thou takest pleasure in my singing.<br/> I know that only as a singer I come before thy presence.<br/><br/>

I touch by the edge of the far-spreading wing of my song thy feet which I could never aspire to reach.<br/><br/>

Drunk with the joy of singing I forget myself and call thee friend who art my lord.<br/><br/>
