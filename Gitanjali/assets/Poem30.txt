I came out alone on my way to my tryst.<br/> But who is this that follows me in the silent dark? <br/><br/>
I move aside to avoid his presence but I escape him not.<br/><br/>

He makes the dust rise from the earth with his swagger; he adds his loud voice to every word that I utter.<br/><br/>

He is my own little self, my lord, he knows no shame; but I am ashamed to come to thy door in his company.<br/><br/>
