On the day when death will knock at thy door what wilt thou offer to him?<br/><br/>

   Oh, I will set before my guest the full vessel of my life -- I will never let him go with empty hands.<br/><br/>

   All the sweet vintage of all my autumn days and summer nights, all the earnings and gleanings of my busy life will I place before him at the close of my days when death will knock at my door.<br/><br/>
