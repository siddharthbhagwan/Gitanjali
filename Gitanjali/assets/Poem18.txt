Clouds heap upon clouds and it darkens.<br/> Ah, love, why dost thou let me wait outside at the door all alone?<br/><br/>

In the busy moments of the noontide work I am with the crowd, but on this dark lonely day it is only for thee that I hope.<br/><br/>

If thou showest me not thy face, if thou leavest me wholly aside, I know not how I am to pass these long, rainy hours.<br/><br/>

I keep gazing on the far-away gloom of the sky, and my heart wanders wailing with the restless wind.<br/><br/>
