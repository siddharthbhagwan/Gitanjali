You came down from your throne and stood at my cottage door.<br/><br/>

I was singing all alone in a corner, and the melody caught your ear.<br/> You came down and stood at my cottage door.<br/><br/>

Masters are many in your hall, and songs are sung there at all hours.<br/> But the simple carol of this novice struck at your love. One plaintive little strain mingled with the great music of the world, and with a flower for a prize you came down and stopped at my cottage door.<br/><br/>
