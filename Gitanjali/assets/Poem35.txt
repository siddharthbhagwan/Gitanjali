Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;<br/>

Where knowledge is free;<br/><br/>

Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;<br/><br/>

Where words come out from the depth of truth;<br/><br/>

Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; <br/><br/>

Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;<br/><br/>

Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action --<br/>

Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.<br/><br/>
