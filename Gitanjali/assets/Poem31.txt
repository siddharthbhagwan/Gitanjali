`Prisoner, tell me, who was it that bound you?'<br/>

`It was my master,' said the prisoner.<br/> `I thought I could outdo everybody in the world in wealth and power, and I amassed in my own treasure-hose the money due to my king.<br/> When sleep overcame me I lay upon the bad that was for my lord, and on waking up I found I was a prisoner in my own treasure-house.' <br/><br/>
`Prisoner, tell me, who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain?'<br/><br/>

`It was I,' said the prisoner, `who forged this chain very carefully.<br/> I thought my invincible power would hold the world captive leaving me in a freedom undisturbed.<br/> Thus night and day I worked at the chain with huge fires and cruel hard strokes.<br/> When at last the work was done and the links were complete and unbreakable, I found that it held me in its grip.'<br/><br/>
