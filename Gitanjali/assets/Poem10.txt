Here is thy footstool and there rest thy feet where live the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.<br/><br/>

When I try to bow to thee, my obeisance cannot reach down to the depth where thy feet rest among the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.<br/><br/>

Pride can never approach to where thou walkest in the clothes of the humble among the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.<br/><br/>

My heart can never find its way to where thou keepest company with the companionless among the poorest, the lowliest, and the lost.<br/><br/>
