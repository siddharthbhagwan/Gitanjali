 I ask for a moment's indulgence to sit by thy side.<br/>The works that I have in hand I will finish afterwards.<br/><br/>

Away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite, and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil.<br/><br/>

Today the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs; <br/>
and the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering grove.<br/>
Now it is time to sit quite, face to face with thee, and to sing dedication of live in this silent and overflowing leisure.<br/><br/>
