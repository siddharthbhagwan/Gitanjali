If thou speakest not I will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it.<br/> I will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil and its head bent low with patience.<br/><br/>

The morning will surely come, the darkness will vanish, and thy voice pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky.<br/><br/>

Then thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds' nests, and thy melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest groves.<br/><br/>
