Light, oh where is the light? Kindle it with the burning fire of desire!<br/><br/>

There is the lamp but never a flicker of a flame -- is such thy fate, my heart? Ah, death were better by far for thee!<br/><br/>

Misery knocks at thy door, and her message is that thy lord is wakeful, and he calls thee to the love-tryst through the darkness of night.<br/><br/>

The sky is overcast with clouds and the rain is ceaseless.<br/> I know not what this is that stirs in me -- I know not its meaning.<br/><br/>

A moment's flash of lightning drags down a deeper gloom on my sight, and my heart gropes for the path to where the music of the night calls me.<br/><br/>

Light, oh where is the light! Kindle it with the burning fire of desire! It thunders and the wind rushes screaming through the void.<br/> The night is black as a black stone.<br/> Let not the hours pass by in the dark.<br/> Kindle the lamp of love with thy life.<br/><br/>
