I thought I should ask of thee -- but I dared not -- the rose wreath thou hadst on thy neck. Thus I waited for the morning, when thou didst depart, to find a few fragments on the bed. And like a beggar I searched in the dawn only for a stray petal or two.<br/><br/>

Ah me, what is it I find? What token left of thy love? It is no flower, no spices, no vase of perfumed water.<br/> It is thy mighty sword, flashing as a flame, heavy as a bolt of thunder. The young light of morning comes through the window and spread itself upon thy bed. The morning bird twitters and asks, `Woman, what hast thou got?' No, it is no flower, nor spices, nor vase of perfumed water -- it is thy dreadful sword.<br/><br/>

I sit and muse in wonder, what gift is this of thine. I can find no place to hide it. I am ashamed to wear it, frail as I am, and it hurts me when press it to my bosom. Yet shall I bear in my heart this honour of the burden of pain, this gift of thine.<br/><br/>

From now there shall be no fear left for me in this world, and thou shalt be victorious in all my strife.<br/>Thou hast left death for my companion and I shall crown him with my life. Thy sword is with me to cut asunder my bonds, and there shall be no fear left for me in the world.<br/><br/>

From now I leave off all petty decorations. Lord of my heart, no more shall there be for me waiting and weeping in corners, no more coyness and sweetness of demeanour.<br/> Thou hast given me thy sword for adornment.<br/> No more doll's decorations for me!<br/><br/>
