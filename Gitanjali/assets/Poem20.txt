On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not.<br/> My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded.<br/><br/>

Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind.<br/><br/>

That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.<br/><br/>

I knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and that this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart.<br/><br/>
