I must launch out my boat. The languid hours pass by on the shore -- Alas for me!<br/>

The spring has done its flowering and taken leave.<br/> And now with the burden of faded futile flowers I wait and linger.<br/><br/>

The waves have become clamorous, and upon the bank in the shady lane the yellow leaves flutter and fall.<br/><br/>

What emptiness do you gaze upon! Do you not feel a thrill passing through the air with the notes of the far-away song floating from the other shore?<br/><br/>
