 Death, thy servant, is at my door. He has crossed the unknown sea and brought thy call to my home.<br/><br/>

   The night is dark and my heart is fearful -- yet I will take up the lamp, open my gates and bow to him my welcome. It is thy messenger who stands at my door.<br/><br/>

   I will worship him placing at his feet the treasure of my heart.<br/><br/>

   He will go back with his errand done, leaving a dark shadow on my morning; and in my desolate home only my forlorn self will remain as my last offering to thee.<br/><br/>
