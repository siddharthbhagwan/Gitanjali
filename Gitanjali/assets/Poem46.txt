I know not from what distant time thou art ever coming nearer to meet me.<br/> Thy sun and stars can never keep thee hidden from me for aye.<br/><br/>

In many a morning and eve thy footsteps have been heard and thy messenger has come within my heart and called me in secret.<br/><br/>

I know not only why today my life is all astir, and a feeling of tremulous joy is passing through my heart.<br/><br/>

It is as if the time were come to wind up my work, and I feel in the air a faint smell of thy sweet presence.<br/><br/>
