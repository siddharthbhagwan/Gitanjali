  In desperate hope I go and search for her in all the corners of my room; I find her not.<br/><br/>

   My house is small and what once has gone from it can never be regained.<br/><br/>

   But infinite is thy mansion, my lord, and seeking her I have to come to thy door.<br/><br/>

   I stand under the golden canopy of thine evening sky and I lift my eager eyes to thy face.<br/><br/>

   I have come to the brink of eternity from which nothing can vanish -- no hope, no happiness, no vision of a face seen through tears.<br/><br/>

   Oh, dip my emptied life into that ocean, plunge it into the deepest fullness. Let me for once feel that lost sweet touch in the allness of the universe.<br/><br/>
