The time that my journey takes is long and the way of it long.<br/><br/>

I came out on the chariot of the first gleam of light, and pursued my voyage through the wildernesses of worlds leaving my track on many a star and planet.<br/><br/>

It is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself, and that training is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a tune.<br/><br/>

My eyes strayed far and wide before I shut them and said `Here art thou!'<br/><br/>

The question and the cry `Oh, where?' melt into tears of a thousand streams and deluge the world with the flood of the assurance `I am!'<br/><br/>
