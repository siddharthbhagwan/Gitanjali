 No more noisy, loud words from me -- such is my master's will. Henceforth I deal in whispers. The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song.<br/><br/>

   Men hasten to the King's market. All the buyers and sellers are there. But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day, in the thick of work.<br/><br/>

   Let then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not their time; and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum.<br/><br/>

   Full many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil, but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him; and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence!<br/><br/>
