I am here to sing thee songs. In this hall of thine I have a corner seat.<br/><br/>

In thy world I have no work to do; my useless life can only break out in tunes without a purpose.<br/><br/>

When the hour strikes for thy silent worship at the dark temple of midnight, command me, my master, to stand before thee to sing.<br/><br/>

When in the morning air the golden harp is tuned, honour me, commanding my presence.<br/><br/>
