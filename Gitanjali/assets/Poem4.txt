Life of my life, I shall ever try to keep my body pure, knowing that thy living touch is upon all my limbs.<br/><br/>

I shall ever try to keep all untruths out from my thoughts, knowing that thou art that truth which has kindled the light of reason in my mind.<br/><br/>

I shall ever try to drive all evils away from my heart and keep my love in flower, knowing that thou hast thy seat in the inmost shrine of my heart.<br/><br/>

And it shall be my endeavour to reveal thee in my actions, knowing it is thy power gives me strength to act.<br/><br/>
