The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures.<br/><br/>

It is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth in numberless blades of grass and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers.<br/><br/>

It is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth and of death, in ebb and in flow.<br/><br/>

I feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life. And my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment.<br/><br/>
