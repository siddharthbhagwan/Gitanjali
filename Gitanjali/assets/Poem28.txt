Obstinate are the trammels, but my heart aches when I try to break them.<br/><br/>

Freedom is all I want, but to hope for it I feel ashamed.<br/><br/>

I am certain that priceless wealth is in thee, and that thou art my best friend, but I have not the heart to sweep away the tinsel that fills my room<br/><br/>

The shroud that covers me is a shroud of dust and death; I hate it, yet hug it in love.<br/><br/>

My debts are large, my failures great, my shame secret and heavy; yet when I come to ask for my good, I quake in fear lest my prayer be granted.<br/><br/>
