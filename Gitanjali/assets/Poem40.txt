The rain has held back for days and days, my God, in my arid heart.<br/> The horizon is fiercely naked -- not the thinnest cover of a soft cloud, not the vaguest hint of a distant cool shower.<br/><br/>

Send thy angry storm, dark with death, if it is thy wish, and with lashes of lightning startle the sky from end to end.<br/><br/>

But call back, my lord, call back this pervading silent heat, still and keen and cruel, burning the heart with dire despair.<br/><br/>

Let the cloud of grace bend low from above like the tearful look of the mother on the day of the father's wrath.<br/><br/>
