In one salutation to thee, my God, let all my senses spread out and touch this world at thy feet.<br/><br/>

Like a rain-cloud of July hung low with its burden of unshed showers let all my mind bend down at thy door in one salutation to thee.<br/><br/>

Let all my songs gather together their diverse strains into a single current and flow to a sea of silence in one salutation to thee.<br/><br/>

Like a flock of homesick cranes flying night and day back to their mountain nests let all my life take its voyage to its eternal home in one salutation to thee.<br/><br/>
