  I boasted among men that I had known you. They see your pictures in all works of mine. They come and ask me, &apos;Who is he?&apos; I know not how to answer them. I say, &apos;Indeed, I cannot tell.&apos; They blame me and they go away in scorn. And you sit there smiling.<br/><br/>

   I put my tales of you into lasting songs. The secret gushes out from my heart. They come and ask me, &apos;Tell me all your meanings.&apos; I know not how to answer them. I say, &apos;Ah, who knows what they mean!&apos; They smile and go away in utter scorn. And you sit there smiling.<br/><br/>
