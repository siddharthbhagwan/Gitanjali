It is the pang of separation that spreads throughout the world and gives birth to shapes innumerable in the infinite sky.<br/><br/>

   It is this sorrow of separation that gazes in silence all nights from star to star and becomes lyric among rustling leaves in rainy darkness of July.<br/><br/>

   It is this overspreading pain that deepens into loves and desires, into sufferings and joy in human homes; and this it is that ever melts and flows in songs through my poet's heart.<br/><br/>
