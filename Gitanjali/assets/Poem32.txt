By all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world.<br/> But it is otherwise with thy love which is greater than theirs, and thou keepest me free.<br/><br/>

Lest I forget them they never venture to leave me alone.<br/> But day passes by after day and thou art not seen. <br/><br/>

If I call not thee in my prayers, if I keep not thee in my heart, thy love for me still waits for my love.<br/><br/>
