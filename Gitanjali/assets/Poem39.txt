When the heart is hard and parched up, come upon me with a shower of mercy.<br/><br/>

When grace is lost from life, come with a burst of song.<br/><br/>

When tumultuous work raises its din on all sides shutting me out from beyond, come to me, my lord of silence, with thy peace and rest.<br/><br/>

When my beggarly heart sits crouched, shut up in a corner, break open the door, my king, and come with the ceremony of a king.<br/><br/>
When desire blinds the mind with delusion and dust, O thou holy one, thou wakeful, come with thy light and thy thunder.<br/><br/>
