Light, my light, the world-filling light, the eye-kissing light, heart-sweetening light!<br/>

Ah, the light dances, my darling, at the centre of my life; the light strikes, my darling, the chords of my love; the sky opens, the wind runs wild, laughter passes over the earth.<br/><br/>

The butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light. Lilies and jasmines surge up on the crest of the waves of light.<br/><br/>

The light is shattered into gold on every cloud, my darling, and it scatters gems in profusion. <br/><br/>

Mirth spreads from leaf to leaf, my darling, and gladness without measure. The heaven's river has drowned its banks and the flood of joy is abroad.<br/><br/>
