The song that I came to sing remains unsung to this day.<br/><br/>

I have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument.<br/><br/>

The time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set; only there is the agony of wishing in my heart.<br/><br/>

The blossom has not opened; only the wind is sighing by.<br/><br/>

I have not seen his face, nor have I listened to his voice; only I have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house.<br/><br/>

The livelong day has passed in spreading his seat on the floor; but the lamp has not been lit and I cannot ask him into my house.<br/><br/>

I live in the hope of meeting with him; but this meeting is notyet.<br/><br/>
