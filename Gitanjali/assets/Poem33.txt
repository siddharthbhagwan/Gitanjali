When it was day they came into my house and said, `We shall only take the smallest room here.'<br/><br/>

They said, `We shall help you in the worship of your God and humbly accept only our own share in his grace'; and then they took their seat in a corner and they sat quiet and meek.<br/><br/>

But in the darkness of night I find they break into my sacred shrine, strong and turbulent, and snatch with unholy greed the offerings from God's altar.<br/><br/>
