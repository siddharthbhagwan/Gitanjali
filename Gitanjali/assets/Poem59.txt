Yes, I know, this is nothing but thy love, O beloved of my heart -- this golden light that dances upon the leaves, these idle clouds sailing across the sky, this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my forehead.<br/><br/>
The morning light has flooded my eyes -- this is thy message to my heart. Thy face is bent from above, thy eyes look down on my eyes, and my heart has touched thy feet.<br/><br/>
