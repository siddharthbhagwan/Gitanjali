 When the creation was new and all the stars shone in their first splendour, the gods held their assembly in the sky and sang &apos;Oh, the picture of perfection! the joy unalloyed!'<br/><br/>

   But one cried of a sudden -- &apos; It seems that somewhere there is a break in the chain of light and one of the stars has been lost.'<br/><br/>

   The golden string of their harp snapped, their song stopped, and they cried in dismay -- &apos;Yes, that lost star was the best, she was the glory of all heavens!'<br/><br/>

   From that day the search is unceasing for her, and the cry goes on from one to the other that in her the world has lost its one joy!<br/>
   Only in the deepest silence of night the stars smile and whisper among themselves -- &apos;Vain is this seeking! unbroken perfection is over all!'<br/><br/>
