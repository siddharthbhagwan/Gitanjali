Let only that little be left of me whereby I may name thee my all.<br/><br/>

Let only that little be left of my will whereby I may feel thee on every side, and come to thee in everything, and offer to thee my love every moment.<br/><br/>

Let only that little be left of me whereby I may never hide thee.<br/><br/>

Let only that little of my fetters be left whereby I am bound with thy will, and thy purpose is carried out in my life -- and that is the fetter of thy love.<br/><br/>
