At this time of my parting, wish me good luck, my friends! The sky is flushed with the dawn and my path lies beautiful.<br/><br/>

   Ask not what I have with me to take there. I start on my journey with empty hands and expectant heart.<br/><br/>

   I shall put on my wedding garland. Mine is not the red-brown dress of the traveller, and though there are dangers on the way I have no fear in mind.<br/><br/>

   The evening star will come out when my voyage is done and the plaintive notes of the twilight melodies be struck up from the King's gateway.<br/><br/>
