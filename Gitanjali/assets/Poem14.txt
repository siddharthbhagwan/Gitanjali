My desires are many and my cry is pitiful, but ever didst thou save me by hard refusals; and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life through and through.<br/><br/>

Day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple, great gifts that thou gavest to me unasked -- this sky and the light, this body and the life and the mind -- saving me from perils of overmuch desire. <br/><br/>

There are times when I languidly linger and times when I awaken and hurry in search of my goal; but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me.<br/><br/>

Day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by refusing me ever and anon, saving me from perils of weak, uncertain desire.<br/><br/>
