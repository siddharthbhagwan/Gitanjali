My song has put off her adornments.<br/> She has no pride of dress and decoration.<br/> Ornaments would mar our union; they would come between thee and me; their jingling would drown thy whispers.<br/><br/>

My poet's vanity dies in shame before thy sight.<br/> O master poet, I have sat down at thy feet.<br/> Only let me make my life simple and straight, like a flute of reed for thee to fill with music.<br/><br/>
