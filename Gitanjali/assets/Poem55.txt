Languor is upon your heart and the slumber is still on your eyes.<br/><br/>

Has not the word come to you that the flower is reigning in splendour among thorns? Wake, oh awaken! let not the time pass in vain!<br/><br/>

At the end of the stony path, in the country of virgin solitude, my friend is sitting all alone. Deceive him not. Wake, oh awaken!<br/><br/>

What if the sky pants and trembles with the heat of the midday sun -- what if the burning sand spreads its mantle of thirst --<br/>

Is there no joy in the deep of your heart? At every footfall of yours, will not the harp of the road break out in sweet music of pain?<br/><br/>
