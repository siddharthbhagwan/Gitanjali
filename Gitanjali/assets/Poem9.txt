O Fool, try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders! O beggar, to come beg at thy own door!<br/><br/>

Leave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all, and never look behind in regret.<br/><br/>

Thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath.<br/> It is unholy -- take not thy gifts through its unclean hands.<br/> Accept only what is offered by sacred love.<br/><br/>
