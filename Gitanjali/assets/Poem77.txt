 I know thee as my God and stand apart -- I do not know thee as my own and come closer. I know thee as my father and bow before thy feet -- I do not grasp thy hand as my friend's.<br/><br/>

   I stand not where thou comest down and ownest thyself as mine, there to clasp thee to my heart and take thee as my comrade.<br/><br/>

   Thou art the Brother amongst my brothers, but I heed them not, I divide not my earnings with them, thus sharing my all with thee.<br/><br/>

   In pleasure and in pain I stand not by the side of men, and thus stand by thee. I shrink to give up my life, and thus do not plunge into the great waters of life.<br/><br/>
