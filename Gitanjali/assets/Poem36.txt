This is my prayer to thee, my lord -- strike, strike at the root of penury in my heart.<br/>

Give me the strength lightly to bear my joys and sorrows.<br/>

Give me the strength to make my love fruitful in service.<br/>

Give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before insolent might.<br/>

Give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles.<br/> 

And give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with love.<br/>
