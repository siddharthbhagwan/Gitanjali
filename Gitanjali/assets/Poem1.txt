Thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure.<br/>
This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life.<br/><br/>

This little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new.<br/><br/>

At the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable.<br/><br/>

Thy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine.<br/>
Ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill.<br/><br/>
