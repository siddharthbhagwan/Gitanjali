I have had my invitation to this world's festival, and thus my life has been blessed.<br/> My eyes have seen and my ears have heard.<br/><br/>

It was my part at this feast to play upon my instrument, and I have done all I could.<br/><br/>

Now, I ask, has the time come at last when I may go in and see thy face and offer thee my silent salutation?<br/><br/>
