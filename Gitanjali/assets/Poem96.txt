When I go from hence let this be my parting word, that what I have seen is unsurpassable.<br/><br/>

   I have tasted of the hidden honey of this lotus that expands on the ocean of light, and thus am I blessed -- let this be my parting word.<br/><br/>

   In this playhouse of infinite forms I have had my play and here have I caught sight of him that is formless.<br/><br/>

   My whole body and my limbs have thrilled with his touch who is beyond touch; and if the end comes here, let it come -- let this be my parting word.<br/><br/>
