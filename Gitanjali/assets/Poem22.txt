In the deep shadows of the rainy July, with secret steps, thou walkest, silent as night, eluding all watchers.<br/><br/>

Today the morning has closed its eyes, heedless of the insistent calls of the loud east wind, and a thick veil has been drawn over the ever-wakeful blue sky.<br/><br/>

The woodlands have hushed their songs, and doors are all shut at every house.<br/> Thou art the solitary wayfarer in this deserted street.<br/> Oh my only friend, my best beloved, the gates are open in my house -- do not pass by like a dream.<br/><br/>
