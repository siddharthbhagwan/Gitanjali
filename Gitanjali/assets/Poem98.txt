  I will deck thee with trophies, garlands of my defeat. It is never in my power to escape unconquered.<br/><br/>

   I surely know my pride will go to the wall, my life will burst its bonds in exceeding pain, and my empty heart will sob out in music like a hollow reed, and the stone will melt in tears.<br/><br/>

   I surely know the hundred petals of a lotus will not remain closed for ever and the secret recess of its honey will be bared.<br/>
   From the blue sky an eye shall gaze upon me and summon me in silence. Nothing will be left for me, nothing whatever, and utter death shall I receive at thy feet.<br/><br/>
