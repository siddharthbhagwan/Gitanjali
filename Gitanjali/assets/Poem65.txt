What divine drink wouldst thou have, my God, from this overflowing cup of my life?<br/><br/>

My poet, is it thy delight to see thy creation through my eyes and to stand at the portals of my ears silently to listen to thine own eternal harmony?<br/><br/>

Thy world is weaving words in my mind and thy joy is adding music to them. Thou givest thyself to me in love and then feelest thine own entire sweetness in me.<br/><br/>
