Time is endless in thy hands, my lord. There is none to count thy minutes.<br/><br/>

   Days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers. Thou knowest how to wait.<br/><br/>

   Thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower.<br/><br/>

   We have no time to lose, and having no time we must scramble for a chances. We are too poor to be late.<br/><br/>

   And thus it is that time goes by while I give it to every querulous man who claims it, and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last.<br/><br/>

   At the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate to be shut; but I find that yet there is time.<br/><br/>
